- 👋 Hi, I’m @huxmui. Whatever magic that happens when you combine a visual communicator, a creative technologist, and a writer/gardener, that is what I do.
- 👀 I’m interested in designing user experiences and user interfaces for open source, internal tools to help communities with a mission reach their objectives. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning no code tools, api integration, automation, and copywriting.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects with a mission to help communities provide solutions for long term survival of many species on Earth.
- 📫 How to reach me: <a href="https://twitter.com/huxmui">@huxmui</a> on Twitter (DM to collab)
